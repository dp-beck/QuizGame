Note on App (In Progress):

This is an app that can be used by multiple people to run a IRL quiz
game. It has two main features. First, a feature to feed a 
question asker a series of questions and answers. Second, a simple
buzzer with sound for the players to use to buzz in.

Things to add:

1. A way to track a score
2. A database with questions
3. A way to add questions
4. A Single Player Mode with a high score scoreboard
5. A way to alert the question master who buzzed in first
6. A way to play not in real life
7. Styling / Editing
